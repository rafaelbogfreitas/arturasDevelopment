## Info:

- ### About this project:

  The concept behind this project was to build a minimalistic website, with no info about the artist apart from his initials. The client wanted his photos to be displayed in an unstructured way and whenever one of them was clicked, to display a carousel of all the pictures on the page.

  A contact form was added to help people get in touch if interested in the work.
